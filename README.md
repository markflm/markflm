Hey, I'm Mark (aka Kifflom) - a Full Stack Web Developer interested in creating projects that provide value for fans of things I'm interested in like esports, music, and stocks.
I'm always looking for opportunities to combine existing services with my own work to create something entirely new.

Right now I'm mostly working in Javascript including TypeScript, Vue, Angular2+ and Nodejs, but I've got a background in C# and database development (ETL, BI Reporting, Data Warehousing). 


You can reach me at mpcrav01 at gmail.com.
