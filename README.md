Hey, I'm Mark (aka Kifflom) - a Full Stack Web and Mobile Developer interested in creating projects that provide value for fans of things I'm interested in like sports, music, and video games.
I'm always looking for opportunities to combine existing services with my own work to create something entirely new.

Right now I'm mostly working in TypeScript including React, React Native, and NodeJS but I've got a background in C# and database development (ETL, BI Reporting, Data Warehousing). 


You can reach me at markcravendev at gmail.com.
