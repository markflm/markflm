Hey, I'm Mark (aka Kifflom) - a Full Stack Web Developer interested in creating projects that provide value for fans of things I'm interested in like esports, music, and stocks.
I'm always looking for opportunities to combine existing services with my own work to create something entirely new.

I'm most familiar with the .NET world but I also have experience with many flavors of Javascript including TypeScript, Angular2+ and Nodejs.


You can reach me at mpcrav01 at gmail.com or on Twitter @Kifflom
